# Extra credit
    In this module we'll explore how to host your snazzy website on Heroku.
    Why Heroku? Simply because heroku works like magic with Git!
    And for us beginners, not having to pull your hair out to try and deploy
    your web app is a god send.
    Oh, and Heroku is free for 'light' users, i.e. for people like you and me.

# The Hosting Conundrun for Beginners

Learning to code is a fun, creative endeavour. At some point, you may want to share your creation with the world... and depending on the technology you used, this can become a real thorn in your side. There's enough to do without having to get pulled into the complexities of deplaying your webapp on a publicly accessible server.

Enter services like Heroku. Hosting providers really try and simplify your life so that you can focus on your app, and not all the piping and infrastructure necessary to make it run. The beauty of Heroku, as we will see, is that it makes deplying your application incredibly easy when you're a git afficionado. And you are one, right?

*emphasis text* for emphasis

**strong text** for strong

Getting literal with `backticks`

    Or use an indent of 4 spaces,
    to get yourself a code block,
    that looks lovely.

> Do a bit of blockquoting. You can still reflow the text as much as you like.
Newlines are awesome.
And made of win.

This is a horizonal rule:

If you want to highlight some ruby code:

{% highlight ruby %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}

Bit of command line:

{% highlight sh %}
$ holla holla
get dolla
$ 
{% endhighlight %}
